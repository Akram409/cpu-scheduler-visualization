# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A comprehensive web-based interactive simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms, developed as a university project. This application implements and visualizes four fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms with detailed performance analysis.

## üöÄ Features

### Implemented Algorithms
1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** - Non-preemptive scheduling based on arrival time
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)** - Non-preemptive scheduling based on burst time
3. **Priority Scheduling** - Non-preemptive scheduling based on process priority
4. **Round Robin (RR)** - Preemptive scheduling with configurable time quantum

### Interactive Features
- ‚úÖ Dynamic process addition and removal
- ‚úÖ Real-time Gantt chart visualization
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive results table with all metrics
- ‚úÖ Performance analysis dashboard
- ‚úÖ Algorithm comparison capabilities
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all devices
- ‚úÖ Example data loading for quick testing
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts for enhanced productivity

### Performance Metrics
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time
- Total Execution Time
- CPU Utilization
- System Throughput

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5, Custom CSS with animations
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6
- **Architecture**: Modular JavaScript with OOP principles
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser
- No additional software installation required

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start adding processes and exploring different algorithms!

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Select Algorithm**: Choose from FCFS, SJF, Priority, or Round Robin
2. **Add Processes**: Enter arrival time, burst time, and priority (if needed)
3. **Configure Settings**: Set time quantum for Round Robin algorithm
4. **Run Simulation**: Click "Run Simulation" to see results
5. **Analyze Results**: View Gantt chart, results table, and performance metrics

## üìä Algorithm Details

### First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **Type**: Non-preemptive
- **Criteria**: Arrival time
- **Advantages**: Simple implementation, no starvation
- **Disadvantages**: Poor average waiting time, convoy effect

### Shortest Job First (SJF)
- **Type**: Non-preemptive
- **Criteria**: Burst time
- **Advantages**: Optimal average waiting time
- **Disadvantages**: Starvation of long processes, requires burst time prediction

### Priority Scheduling
- **Type**: Non-preemptive
- **Criteria**: Process priority (lower number = higher priority)
- **Advantages**: Important processes get preference
- **Disadvantages**: Starvation of low-priority processes

### Round Robin (RR)
- **Type**: Preemptive
- **Criteria**: Time quantum rotation
- **Advantages**: Fair allocation, good response time
- **Disadvantages**: Higher context switching overhead

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic FCFS Simulation
```
Process | Arrival | Burst
P1      | 0       | 5
P2      | 1       | 3
P3      | 2       | 8
```

### Example 2: Priority Scheduling
```
Process | Arrival | Burst | Priority
P1      | 0       | 5     | 2
P2      | 1       | 3     | 1
P3      | 2       | 8     | 3
```

### Example 3: Round Robin (Time Quantum = 2)
```
Process | Arrival | Burst
P1      | 0       | 5
P2      | 1       | 3
P3      | 2       | 8
```
